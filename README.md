# CSE151B-SP23-Kaggle-Competition

## INTRODUCTION
In this course, you will learn the fundamentals in deep learning. Part of the learning will be through in-class lectures and take-home assignments, but you will really gain hands-on experience by participating Machine Learning Competitions.

## COMPETITION FORMAT
You will participate in the competition via Kaggle in small groups, normally 1-4 people. The project contributes to 35% of the course credits:
- 5 % milestone report
- 10 % final report
- 10 % final presentation
- 10 %  team ranking 
In the end, you will write a 4 page report about your project.

## Details
In this competition, you will develop deep learning models to predict the trip time of taxi rides in Porto, Portugal based on their (initial) partial trajectories.
