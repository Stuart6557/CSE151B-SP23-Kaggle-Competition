# CSE151B-SP23-Kaggle-Competition

## Running the Model

- The .ipynb file we used to create and train a new model is located in XGBoost-Project.ipynb
- The saved model weights are located in model.json
- To load the saved model and run inference, open Load-XGBoost-Project.ipynb and run all the cells inside it.
  - This contains data loading and preprocessing, model loading, and inference.
  - DataHub's kernel would crash/run out of memory when attempting to load the full size model, but we've verified that the cells work on a lighter weight model
  - The inference output might not be the exact same as our best Kaggle submission since we didn't save that model, but they should be in the same ballpark of scoring.

## INTRODUCTION

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals in deep learning. Part of the learning will be through in-class lectures and take-home assignments, but you will really gain hands-on experience by participating Machine Learning Competitions.

## COMPETITION FORMAT

You will participate in the competition via Kaggle in small groups, normally 1-4 people. The project contributes to 35% of the course credits:

- 5 % milestone report
- 10 % final report
- 10 % final presentation
- 10 % team ranking
  In the end, you will write a 4 page report about your project.

## Details

In this competition, you will develop deep learning models to predict the trip time of taxi rides in Porto, Portugal based on their (initial) partial trajectories.
